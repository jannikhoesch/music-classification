# Spotify Music Genre Classification

This repository contains a university project that I created together with Annamaria Vass for the course Machine Learning at the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya. The goal is to predict music genres using Spotify's song dataset. The notebook documents our approach, methodologies, and results, highlighting the effectiveness of various models in predicting music genres.

## Files

- `genre_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all the code, analyses, and results.
- `ml_report.pdf`: Extensive project report describing our methods and results.
- `genres_v2.csv`: Dataset containing samples for classification.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.7 or above
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Usage
1.	Download the project folder.
2.	Open the notebook `genre_classification.ipynb`.
3.	Add the dataset file `genres_v2.csv` to the runtime.
4.	Install the requirements.
5.	Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.
